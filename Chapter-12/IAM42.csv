JG,"My own definition of culture is: A group of people who share and follow a set of spoken and in some cases unspoken beliefs, ideas, traditions, values, and knowledge both tacit and explicit. My own definition of eLearning is: Learning and teaching that utilizes technology and electronic media formats over traditional resources. The three pillars that determine the success or failure of e-learning programs are the interconnectedness among (1) person, (2) behavior, and (3) environment. These are the three major areas that interventions should target. 1.E-learners' cognitive skills: E-learners must have the prerequisite knowledge and skills necessary to participate in e-learning. Computer competency through training, and practice, and time management skills are essential. 2.Environment: Organizations must support e-learning by offering a supportive culture, incentives, models, resources, and fostering e-learning self-efficacy. 3. Belief and behavior: E-learners' must have high e-learning self-efficacy and the appropriate behavioral skills such as taking responsibility for learning (Mungania, 2003). From this example in the research article 'The Seven eLearning Barriers Facing Employees,' I begin to see where eLearning and culture can have some commonalities. I believe that like these 3 pillars that determine the success or failure of eLearning programs, these 3 pillars can create or remove barriers within a culture. I notice how culture is associated with traits such as cognitive skills of the culture, the environment in which the culture thrives, and the beliefs and behaviors of the culture. As we implement eLearning strategies into different cultures, we must look at these 3 pillars to create and maintain a successful eLearning program for the target culture. ELearning, like culture is not one size fits all and requires some different approaches to how it is employed in order to suit the target culture. I look forward to your definitions and to this discussion, have a great week everyone!"
JL,"I agree that there must be high consideration of learner support in an eLearning environment.  I hadn't considered that in my definition, but it did remind me of my days as a supervisor, and how important it was to recognize when employees were struggling, and remove obstacles to aid in their success.  In turn, there must be some learner/employee accountability, and you mentioned that as well. One of the courses I teach is called Situational Leadership II (Blanchard, 1993), and provides a model for leadership styles that depend on individual situations (not the employee in general).  It really helps to put standards in place so that the playing field is leveled for all in management.  I believe the same applies to learners. My personal definition of culture: 'how things work' in a system that includes individuals and the beliefs, practices and interactions that occur daily. One can be involved in many different cultures, for example, family or large organizations, with sub-cultures embedded within (three sisters within a family, or a team within an organization), who in turn have their own way of 'how things work.' With a culture comes a set of unwritten rules for interaction that others outside of the culture must also have, since these behaviors can affect whether the outsider is allowed in, or not (unfortunately).  I think a great example for overcoming that barrier is, again, to set expectations up front; we saw a discussion participation rubric/self-assessment critera during last night's web conference, which let us know the rules of engagement.  Those standards for communication help set up a healthy and inclusive discussion environment (we can agree or disagree, we just have to agree on what is considered 'doing it nicely,' which can be its own challenge!). My personal definition of eLearning: educational content within an electronic learning system, accessible online/using the internet. The online educational content can include additional learning options such as pre and post tests, grading, blogging/discussion boards, email messaging, cafe socialization areas and modules that break down the learning into chunks. I like your 3 pillars that determine success or failure of an eLearning program, and also how you say they are 'not one size fits all,' because we have an obligation to provide some flexibility in our design, in order to promote collaborative knowledge creation and transformational learning.  I'm curious about the incentives, so was wondering if you could provide an example of an incentive for eLearning? Thanks for your post, it was a great start to our discussion!"
MM,"When I think of culture, the first thing that comes to my mind is ones customs and beliefs. Culture to me is taught or inherited by our close family members. We are taught certain beliefs, ideas, values and information early in age and as we grow older we become accustom to these ideas and beliefs and begin to accept and value them. Elearning has to do with learning via the internet, using today's media and technologies, such as computers, laptops, iPads and mobile smart phones. While doing a little research on culture and elearning I came across a great website that describes how the two go hand in hand (http://www.greller.eu/joomla/index.php/skills/9-generalknowledge-innovation/8-strategic-e-learning): To make e-learning an integral part of an institution it has to be firmly embedded within its business processes and strategic developments. This requires an enormous cultural change that not only affects lecturers as is often believed, but goes right from the top management to all sectors of the institution. It is a transformational change affecting everyone. Cultural change on this scale takes time and effort. The usual picture is the bell curve with the fast adopters at the forefront of development, followed by the mainstream and tailed by those reluctant or unable to change. Mainstreaming a development always comes with a training requirement. A good strategy incorporates these training and migration issues.' I thought this particular paragraph was a great addition to the 3 pillars JG described in his post regarding the person, environment and behavior. Great posts so far, thanks you two for getting the discussion started."
LW,"I, too , am enjoying this conversation. I like the quote you used, MM, in your reply. I was thinking about culture and eLearning...your quote mentions that an enormous culture change must occur when an institution embarks on an online education delivery system. I think it is specifically referring to the culture of the institution but it can also apply to the larger concept of culture. Part of the program I run is English as a second language, and in Los Alamos, our ESL students come from all over the world. I find it interesting the many ways that the different cultures learned in their home countries. Asian students tend to learn in the old-fashioned manner of lecture and rote memorization. They can sit for hours listening to their instructor. Of course, I'm generalizing. My S. Korean students love to take tests!They see them as the primary way to measure what they've learned. So when they come to our classes, most of them (not all) are pleased and surprised with the discussion format of most of our classes and other more interactive ways of learning. We have  Our Chinese students tell me they didn't necessarily have 'tiger' parents but the schools were very much so. Students start early in the day, study all day and then work with tutors into the night. Our Mexican students love to talk so they enjoy our classes because there is a lot of discussion and hands-on activities. These are live classes; imagine how the different students from different cultures would react to an online class. I think that culture is a system, designed over time, that reflects the ideals, mores, customs, and beliefs of people who live in the same part of the world. eLearning is also a system, a system that requires more than one player if it is to be done well. Each participant contributes something to the system in terms of platforms, course design, student support, etc. If the eLearning system is not designed well, and with cultural learning differences in mind, then it won't be effective."
AJ,"JG, These are brilliant definitions of culture and eLearning. I appreciate your inclusion of the words 'tacit' and 'explicit' as I completely skipped over these essential terms when coming up with my own ideas about it. However, I would like to raise one question with your defintion of culture. You define culture as 'A group of people...' What about when it's used as an object of possesion. For example, 'My culture', 'This is my culture', and so on. Just my thoughts. I learned quite a bit by your comprehensive definition of e-Learning. I'm brand new to OLIT this semester and this is the first time I've come across the three pillars of a successful e-Learning program. I definitely learned a lot here. Thanks! "
AJ,"Hi LW, You mentioned ESL and I just had to respond! I've been an ESL teacher in Asia for 6, going on 7, years now. I'm glad to see that your conclusions about Asian students measure up with my own observations. It's generally considered improper to generalize (no pun intended) in America but I think one can generalize the behaviors of students from countries like Japan and China. I say this because there is a striking consistency in actions among people/students from these places. Also. the 'drill and kill' approach used in public schools in these countries is not only common but expected by these students and their parents. I'm not sure if that's why they take to it so well or the other way around...chicken or egg? Also, yes Chinese and Japanese students go to school six days a week, often from morning to night. However, in Japan the pace of learning was much different than here in the U.S. Student's would mold their lives around school but that also meant plenty of social interaction and sleeping during these class hours. One just had to be in attendance and not necessarily awake to be considered 'present' for class. I later found the same thing applied to the adults when attending meetings, haha. Whew, I wrote a mini essay there. Thanks for sharing, LW, and it's great to meet another ESL teacher! "
EP,"Defining culture and e-learning and discussing how they interact. Wow, I love this thread already! :) So I really liked JL's use of the word 'systems' in her definition, so I'll begin there. My definition would be: Culture is a system of beliefs, traditions, customs, values, ideas, languages and behaviors shared by a group of people. I liked the idea of systems because its socially collaborative, meaning it allows for these different aspects of culture to interact and influence each other as well as allows for sub-cultures to exist in a larger cultural framework. My definition of e-Learning would be: Learning that utilizes technology like video, media, texting, and/or the internet to deliver content to the learner and allows for interactivity between theE learner, material, teacher and other students. Here, I appreciate JG's '3 pillars' because its an excellent way of blending e-Learning  ideas with cultural concepts, the individul, behavior, and environment. I can see all of these aspects affecting the learning experience. The first being just having the prerequisite knowledge, which JG brings up, for example my parent's generation might not be as confortable or experienced with technology as younger generations.  The second being cultural behaviors. I've had this experience myself teaching Chinese students Oral English online. One common problem is that no one will want to speak up. You can imagine how unproductive that is in an oral English Class! I learned from discussing the issue with students as well as co-workers that its partly a cultural issue. The students don't want to 'stand-out' in the classroom or be seen as a if they are 'showing off' in class, its very much looked down upon in Chinese society to act that way. The third one, environment. This might involve the infastructure, stability of a country, or even social ideas. I know in China we often had connectivity issues because of the internet speed. The Chinese use a firewall to block information this actually chokes the signal and causes slow internet speed. This can make it difficult to teach and learn in an online situation. That's all for now~!"
EP,"Hello MM, I appreciate this point you came across in your reading, 'To make e-learning an integral part of an institution it has to be firmly embedded within its business processes and strategic developments. This requires an enormous cultural change that not only affects lecturers as is often believed, but goes right from the top management to all sectors of the institution. It is a transformational change affecting everyone.' I've witnessed this personally when working with the Chinese company I teach for, called HJ. They are online language company that developed in China with Chinese business practices, methodologies, etc. I have noticed that their interactions with 'foriegn teachers' or native English speakers tend to fall flat or are very hesistant because they have little experience working with 'Western workers.' AJ and I were the second/third native English speakers that had ever worked there! I think we integrated with them well because we'd spent a fair amount of time in Asia so we were able to navigate and intuit much of what they needed (not to say we didn't butt heads!!) but they continue to have problems hiring a full-time Foriegn staff member. One reason I think are the different cultural expectations involved in the hiring process. The Chinese were very shocked when 'Westerners' would out right ask about Visas, taxes, pay, holidays etc. as they see these as something that's just not done! 'It's very rude'! But for a 'Westerner' abroad these are very real concerns that help us determine whether the company is trustworthy and reliable or to put it another, so we know 'what we are getting into.' For the Chinese, they first get hired, make it past the probationary point, then discuss pay etc. Also, from the 'Western' perspective the Chinese staff will often skirt around these issues or hesistate to answer the question directly (as its common practice not to give direct answers) this tends to turn-off the 'Westerner' as it comes across as sort of 'shady' untrustworthy behavior, but of course its not intended as such. So yes, for e-learning to  integrate into a company/schools practice the institution must at least be AWARE of these differences to really make it work. :)"
EP,"Hi LW, Its great that you are helping so many adult learners through your ESL program. (If you ever develop an online component, please consider me! :P) I don't think you are over-generalizing when describing the cultural learning practices of your students. It is common practice, at least, in my experience that the Asian institutions do teach that way: lecture, remote memorization, and a preoccupation with exams. One thing I often remind my ESL students of is that learning a language is also about learning culture. How we use the language, for example English, to express ourselves reflects cultural programming. It does not mean that they can not use English to express their own individual personalities rather to experience the full flavor of the English language they need to have the experience of using it as a native-speaker would. In this case, having a discussion aspect in a classroom and expressing their opinions, agreeing and disagreeing etc. is a common cultural practice for American-English students/speakers and its important that ESL learners are at least aware of or familiar with this style of communication. I find that this type of explanation (usually a much simpler version) helps students, who are uncomfortable engaging in this style of learning or communication, understand why they are doing it, even if they don't like it!!"
AJ,"My personal definition of culture is: a particular set of actions, behaviors, and beliefs that, when shared in by a group of people, result in a sense of identity. This identity distinguishes between those in the group and those outside it. My definition of eLearning is the process of instruction, based in technology, that includes significant interaction between the teacher and student. I think the most obvious connection between culture and eLearning would be the aims, goals and lesson content provided in the learning. All three aspects will be heavily influenced by not only the dominant culture of where the institution is located but also dictated by the culture (if any) of the target audience attending. Then there is the culture within the eLearning institution. In the case of systems approach there are many different parts creating a whole. An internal culture that supports the needs of the learner as well as being connected to the proper content, teaching methodology, and means of implementation would have a essential influence on the effectiveness of the program. Third, is my own observation. Self-directed learning seems to be the current paradigm in eLearning (I could be wrong about this, this is my first semester in OLIT :D). SDL is a process of learning that occurs when the student takes the initiative in identifing objectives and the methods for solving them. This, I argue, works fine in a place like the U.S.A. where we are taught to be independent thinkers. However, I argue that this model may not be as effective in countries whose cultures emphasize the group over the individual. In these societies, decisions are most often made in groups. I am thinking of my time in Asia as an example. Students from these cultures may not have the prerequisite knowledge or skills necessary to solve a problem individually. Does that mean that instructors have to evolve their methods to include group-directed learning? So, when implementing eLearning in cultures different from our own I think efforts will have to made to accomodate the eccentricities of the dominant culture. Thus, culture does influence eLearning. Those are my thoughts, thank you! "
BS,"What a devilishly difficult assignment! It's times like these that I sort of regret focussing so heavily on science stuff in my formal education.  I think it's a handicap for this kind of task - it isn't that I don't have enough words, most of my family will tell you I have plenty, but it has to do with the assembly of them when the 'right' answer is not static and prescribed. (I tried going to Wikipedia to break through my writer's block and nearly drowned in the words there; so I'm here just trying to express it like a five-year old.) Culture: The summation of the social influences exerted by family, friends, education, language, religion, nationality, art and media, and literature on an individual. eLearning: Learning facilitated by interactive technology linking teacher and student, whether direct and personal (e.g., this class) or indirect and impersonal (e.g., watching TED talks or taking an automated online defensive driving class in which you never communicate with the original course designer or an instructor). So... that's all I have. Please be kind."
LW,"Hi AJ, I just learned that myself about Chinese students -- that they don't necessarily stay awake while spending all those hours in school. This year, we have a young Chinese woman who is our ESL intern. She told me that in China there is usually a long lunch break during which people will take a quick nap before they face the rest of the day. She said people at their offices will put up a Closed sign and curl up on their desks... "
LW,"I agree, EP, and I tell my students something similar. I believe that learning a new language fluently requires learning a whole new way of thinking, one that is tied to the culture that speaks that language. "
CJ,"Hello class- great discussion going on here! My definitions were as follows: 1. Culture- a people-centered (language, ethnicity, biological factors, etc.) group of norms, beliefs, values and/or judgements that drive explicit and implicit behavior within a specific context (i.e. family, work group, school, state, region, country, etc.) 2. eLearning- Learning that occurs via an electronic medium. I mentioned in my journal post that I sort of 'wimped out' on the eLearning definition, keeping it superficial.  I really couldn't think about going into the different types of electronic mediums there were (technologies) and the who/what/when/where's of how people use them without getting overwhelmed.  Then, I thought of all the types of electronic mediums that can exist even without the internet and just left it at the definition you see above. JL, I wanted comment on your comment regarding culture.  I really liked how you mentioned 'sub-cultures' and as other have echoed, it is important to remind ourselves that cultures can be layered upon each other depending on the person.  This is probably what I had in mind when I mentioned 'people-centered'... maybe 'people-centric' might have been a more effective word to use, but nonetheless, it expresses how culture is unique to each person's experience(s).  It also reminds me that culture can exist in the background too, not loud and outright in the open. As far as how culture and eLearning might be connected, I liked what LW said: 'If the eLearning system is not designed well, and with cultural learning differences in mind, then it won't be effective.'  I also read an interesting article that stated 'Learning style preferences are shaped by culture, which provide the 'mold' by which we obtain, process and use information.' (http://umaine.edu/projectopportunity /files/2011/07/Vol2_7.pdf)  It describes how culture shapes the different psychological, sociological, emotional, psysiological, and physical factors which serve as a lens (our eyes) for learning preferences, including a preference for learning through technology."
JG,"Hi JL,     I liked in your definition of eLearning how you mentioned additional learning options such as modules that break down the learning into chunks. I am a big believer in the concept of 'chunking' information so that it can be easily recalled later, especially when studying for an exam. I see what you mean in this instance, because there is a lot of information for us to juggle in an online course and if we did not have modules to help us break down the information into smaller portions, I believe that it would be much more difficult to learn in an online environment. In F2F courses, they usually just give you all the information in a lecture and then you are required to memorize it for later use in a research paper or on an exam. However, in online courses, we are expected to use the information and apply it to real world situations and this is where that obligation to provide some flexibility in our designs comes into focus, along with the design of the course itself.     From the article where I got the 3 pillars of eLearning, I figure that they mean incentives for eLearning in a workplace environment such as the incentive of taking an online course or degree program with the incentive of increased salary or even in our academic environment where our incentive for eLearning is a degree or certificate that can lead to a better job. These are just some things I came up with, there are other incentives to eLearning such as being able to learn at your own pace, wherever you choose, at what ever time. This is what I took from the article, perhaps there are other incentives? Great post! Have a wonderful 3 day weekend:)"
JG,"Hi CJ,     I liked your definition of culture, especially how you worded it with being 'people-centered.' This was a perfect wording of what I was trying to rack my brain to come up with! I ended up stating a 'group of people,' however, this is incorrect because culture does not always refer to a group of people and can refer to traits or even tangible things within a group of people. I also liked how you mentioned the importance of the context in which behavior within a culture occurs. This is important, because what is perfectly acceptable within one culture is not acceptable within another and this is due to cultural beliefs, but also the context in which these behaviors occur. I see how my definition of culture is being restructured with every new definition I read in this post! Great posting, have a nice Labor Day weekend:)"
JG,"Hi AJ!     Thank you for the vote of confidence in how well my definitions of culture and eLearning were! I am learning more and more as I read posts that I need to re-think my original definitions:) Ha ha. You are completely correct and I just posted a reply to CJ concerning my wording of a 'group of people.' I now see that culture can definitely be used in a much broader context than just people. I totally agree that it can be used to define even inantimate objects such as the way a certain culture dresses or even in a psychological context of how a certain culture behaves in certain situations. Thank you for bringing this to my attention:) I'm glad you learned a lot out of the 3 pillars of eLearning I got from the article. If you have time, the complete article is very interesting and can be found at: http://aerckenya.org /docs/ElearningReport.pdf Thank you for your insightful comments and have a great Labor Day weekend!"
JG,"Hi MM,     I liked you definitions of culture and eLearning, especially how it is taught or inherited by us from close family members. I relate to this as I am Hispanic and live in Santa Fe, NM where this concept of generativity involving culture is very prominent. I was initially taught by my elders what was culutally acceptable and what was not, however, as I grow and age, I find some of those things that I was taught by my elders to be either true or very false. I see this with my niece and her daughter (I am a 29 year old Great-Uncle:) and how she is already instilling our cultural knowledge within her. I also like the website you found and how eLearning is a transformational change that affects everyone. I believe it is very uncomfortable and shocking for some to realize that you do not need a brick and mortar institution with teachers and students present in the classroom for someone to learn well. This change of thinking requires some transformational learning (OLIT 561:) to make the transition from traditional learning to eLearning successful. Great post, have a great weekend! "
TK,"I define Culture as the combined affect on a person by the people, locations, education, and experiences they have been exposed to in their lifetime. I used to teach middle school and a large component of my work was helping kids define their communities, and their rights and responsibilities in those communities. I feel like I'm living my class in a higher education setting! As for eLearning, I would say that it is any kind of knowledge transfer that occurs via a modern electronic medium including computer, phones, smart phones, tablets.t"
TK,"JL, I love your point that culture is unwritten rules that everyone follows. It makes me think of the different departments I work with and the tricky issue of the lunch hour'. For some, the lunch hour is truly a time when people are gone from their desks, for others it's considered a time to get caught up on your own before heading to more meetings, and still another group considers it totally normal to schedule all kinds of meetings over the lunch hour with no consideration for food at the meeting. I feel like the managers and high-level executives over a department often influence this type of decision, but it's an example of how a little thing, one hour a day, can cause a lot of strife and challenge in a small work environment. I cannot imagine the implications on a large scale of those unspoken norms.'"
KB,"I really enojoyed reading about and thinking though everyone's thoughts on both culture and elearning.  I decided to try to start combining some of these ideas to incorporate the important ideas everyone brought up.  Below is my original definition, and the redefined version (in bold).  Thanks to everyone for helping to extend and push my thinking.  I thin-k, especially with culture, I was really limiting my definition to a broader, big picture definition and forgetting about how culture also exists in small groups. Culture: Original: To me, culture is the conglomeration of all of the people, situations, and environmental factors around a person that work together to create their identity.  This includes geography, language, values, social influences/norms /expectations/customs, race, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, political interactions, sexual orientation, and gender identification. Redefined: Culture is a people-centered set of shared contexts related to beliefs, ideas, traditions, values, knowledge that contribute to a system of practices and interactions that is either shared, built, or imposed on a defined group.  These contexts are often built by family, friends, language, experiences, religion, education, ethnicity, race, public influence, socio-economic status, political interactions, sexual identities, social norms and expectations, geography, and values, and helps to create individual personal identities. E-learning: original: To me, elearning is any time a person learns something or teaches something via electronic media of any variety.  This could be directed by self or others and could be formal or informal.  It could include components of traditional classroom learning, or could be completely atypical of classroom learning. Redefined: Elearning is learning or teaching facilitated by electronic media of any variety, or device and is typically dependant on transactions via Internet.  This could be directed by self or others and could be formal or informal.  It could include components of traditional classroom learning, or could be completely atypical of classroom learning (use of a learning management system)."
JL,"Hi KB, Your synthesis here is awesome - I also learned so much from the discussions and am definitely in a different state of mind regarding culture.  You reminded me of something - I forget that sometimes aspects of our particular culture(s) can be imposed on us, and can extend on multiple levels; for instance, as a child, I was taught that being respectful meant not questioning opinions of our elders, however, not thinking outside of the box prevented me from wanting to learn different perspectives - until much later (high school and college).  Now, at family gatherings where there are still those few elders in attendance, it can be a challenge to 'switch gears' when talking to the different sets of family members (now subcultures), but in order to avoid insulting or even alienating others, it becomes almost necessary to do just that. "
JL,"Hi JG, yes, I agree, what some may have decided is a 'non-issue' can mean all the difference in someone's day.  To KB's point, when aspects of a culture are imposed on us, we tend to follow suit to avoid conflict.  I wonder what would happen if folks declined meetings (electronic appointments on email), or did not show for the lunch meetings with the reason being 'sorry, that is during my lunch hour.'  Would there be a chance to find a more opportune time (group decision) or would it seem that these folks do not care about the overall well-being of the company?  You are right, it depends on which culture you choose to be a part of, which unfortunately can divide people in departments, prevent collaboration and productivity, and cause unspoken grief for many folks."
JL,"Hi JG, ok, I see what you are saying about incentives, thanks for the clarification.  I remember when I first began the OLIT program, I enrolled in an online class and felt so overwhelmed; I was so thankful for the support of my fellow classmates, the instructor and the technical support that was brought to my attention immediately, as well as the discussions of 'why online classes are beneficial.'  I was drawn to the incentives of mobile accessibility and learning at my own pace.  Thanks again!"
LM,"I have read through the threads in this section, and I am very impressed with the level of thoughtfulness and the extent of teaching experience embedded in this group. I feel fortunate to be part of this class. I do not come from a similar background as most of you. BS is perhaps the closest classmate with whom I can identify a cultural similarity. I have never been an 'official' teacher other than a lab instructor for freshmen physics students. In an unofficial capacity, I have taught employees and military personnel in my charge specific skills that would allow them to advance in their careers. What follows is my definitions: Culture: To be able to define this term, it is necessary to determine its context. For a biologist, it is something to be found in a Petri dish. For a health food enthusiast, it's yogurt; and for a Brooklynite, pronouncing the word with the empathesis on the second syllable, it's what Upper West Side Manhattanites use for amusement. I suspect that for our purposes, we had better not stray too far from a socio-political or even an anthropological context. I believe it to be an all-encompassing term for what takes place whenever two or more people interact. We are not to limit ourselves to the physical aspects of this interaction, but must examine the psychological, emotional and spiritual components of such interactions if we are to grasp the true meaning of the concept. I suppose that under these conditions or criteria, culture could be nothing short of human life itself. Indeed, what would human life be if not for its interpersonal interactions. For how do we build anything - whether that be families, nations or bridges - without human interaction? So culture is that quality of human existence that is defined by the interaction of its participants. eLearning: This is a loaded term. At first glance, this simple and innocent-looking combination of two words, more accurately a letter and a word, seems a necessary consequence of our modern world. On the surface, the word carries the meaning of combining leaning and electronic. But it is safe to say that in today's world, the meaning of electronic has subtly shifted to digital in this context. With this shift, the meaning has incorporated the concept of a computer and the use of it as a tool to gain access to the virtual world of information. Now we enter a speculative area whereby we can envision a brave new world where learning is enhanced by these electronic access tools. This is no longer a simple combining of meanings, but a paradigm shift in perspective. This is accomplished by the unavoidable comparison between the human brain and computers, and an even more profound comparison between the human nervous system and the WWW/Internet. What are we to do? This new world is ours to explore with all its euphoric epiphanies and hidden dangers. May we have the wisdom to know the difference? LM, Aug 26, 2012 Back to the discussion thread: I was taken by EP's comment about how learning a new language is synonymous with learning a new culture. Culture here refers to a population of people that share the same language. This points to the close connection between language and the culture in which that language is used. If we examine the linguistic structure of such a language, do we gain insight into how to deal with or design learning systems for different ethic or cultural groups? An example of this would be the direct translation of the term in the Russian language for speed-bump: policeman lying down. The results of the meaning for speed bump is the same in either language, but the cultural background that provides the image is quite different. There was a lot of discussion about the Asian cultures having a negative perception of individualism. I have always found the Japanese expression 'the nail that sticks out gets hammered down' a wonderful window into the heart of the Japanese, and by extension, Asia societies. This feeling might have something to do with the hierarchical structure of Asian societies that existed until recent history. Malcolm Gladwell describes in his book 'Outliers' how this hierarchical structure can have dire consequences when employed in a modern technological setting such as an airplane cockpit. There is much more to comment upon in the threads, but enough said for the time being. "
KB,"JL, I really didn't even put that piece together until I started thinking about what others were saying were the contributing factors.  From that I realized that we don't have the control we sometimes connect with culture.  We actually are probably subject to our cultural factors more than we choose?  Right?  At least that's where my thoughts started going."
KB,"LM, I really identify with your ideas about how culture impacts how we can translate information.  I remember in my time teaching, that I was always pushed to think about how my identity, things familiar to me used as examples might not be the same for my students.  What becomes really tricky is thinking about the diversity that we now encounter in group settings.  Measuring the difference in culture and addressing it equally across all groups is a real challenge in teaching. Thanks for your thoughts!"
CJ,"Hi JG, Thanks for your response.  As I read the readings assigned for this week, and also including the Iron & Silk videos, my definition is also being restructured too.  It makes me question if the definition of culture itself is fluid since new types of cultures can/are being developed from different contexts all the time?  What I've gathered so far that culture in relation to a specific context such as 'eLearning' is a very compLM thing! Hope you have had a relaxing Labor Day weekend! "
CJ,"Hi KB/JL Enjoyed reading your conversation here and where your thoughts lead you.  Your question about how we are probably subject to our cultural factors more than we choose is an insightful one.  I personally think this is true for myself.  I have noticed that around certain groups of people, certain TV shows I watch, certain family members, certain areas of the country I've lived in, certain books I've read, etc. I am shaped by them, but not noticeably.  And I can imagine that there are many other cultural influences that have in fact influenced me that I cannot account for whatsoever because I am constantly surrounded by them, and they are happening 'in the background' so to speak. "
CJ,"Hi LM, Enjoyed reading your post as well.  I took not of your comment about EP's comment on language: 'Culture here refers to a population of people that share the same language.'  I read this in a way that made me think about how language isn't limited to English, German, French, Cantonese, Japanese, etc.  Cultures develop their own 'languages' on top of the actual language people speak. "
AN,"After reading the posts and thinking about my own definition of Culture and eLearning, I decided to approach it from my own point of view.  Because of my husband being retired military I have lived not only in Europe, but all over the United States.  Because I am not European I decided to define Culture as an American.  Defining culture from an American point of view is tricky.  Ultimately we are all from somewhere else and do not have the kinds of cultural roots that people from other countries have.  Culture changes depending on where in the US you live.  New Mexico culture is vastly different than the Midwestern culture I grew up in.  Different foods, beliefs, attitudes, and even language.  I tried to look at it from a larger perspective as to what binds us Americans together.  I believe that the Constitution is first and foremost what sets us apart from the rest of the world and what binds us together regardless of where we live. We grow up being taught the Constitution and believing in the rights and privileges that it affords us.  I liked the idea of subcultures.  I think the region where you grew up or live presently is a subculture within the US, and I also think that your family would be a sub subculture. As far as eLearning is concerned, I like KB's definiton that learning and teaching is facilitated by technology.  I also felt that JG's three pillars were a very succint want of describing the eLearning process.  Initially I had a definition in my head of eLearning, but I saw some internet research that my daughter had printed out for her AP Biology class.  It got my thinking eLearning can occur even in a traditional classroom setting. Then if eLearning doesn't HAVE to occur in a setting where the students are separated from the teacher and getting their instruction solely online, then what is it?  It sort of made my head spin to think of all the ways eLearning can be defined and why it is so difficult.  I think that is why I like KB's and JG's defnitions the best."
BS,"LM, CJ, KB That thing about culture being reflected in language really struck me. Having spent a fair amount of time in the recent past working with my daughter to translate a police report from Dutch to English for an insurance claim - knowing no Dutch myself and my daughter only knowing a little conversational Dutch - that is most certainly the case. In case you haven't tried it, Google translate mangles Dutch (both directions) and part of the reason is that the entire attitude toward the world is different. We tell our kids to 'Do your best! Be good!' and Dutch parents tell their children 'Be normal!'The idioms are so completely foreign as to render some meanings completely incomprehensible. The opportunity for misinterpretations in email can be enormous. For instance, I innocently forwarded an invitation to a risk manager's organization to my former Director - the description of the organization seemed as if it were at a higher management level than I occupied, and I thought she might like to make contact with the important people reported to be members of the group. I made a self-deprecating joke about it being 'too rich for my blood.' She was so offended that she gave me a verbal reprimand in front of my immediate supervisor for passing along the email. I had no idea I had said anything wrong! Those of you that teach ESL or speak multiple languages - I can't even imagine how you manage the cultural divides.  My hat is off to you. ('my cap is gone to you.')"
BS,"TK - On the lunch hour thing, and similar workplace norming... in my opinion, it is incumbent on the manager to make those 'unspoken norms' spoken.  In addition, if the manager does not himself generally conform to the expected behavior, the standard for the department will undoubtedly slip to a norm closer to the manager's demonstrated behavior rather than the stated expected behavior. For instance, a manager that tells the staff that lunch hours are no more than 60 minutes, but takes two-hour lunches himself, should not be surprised that the 60 minute standard is not obersved. This discussion does make me think of something else. You guys, my classmates, have revealed some things about your cultures on the boards. Some were brought up never to question elders, some were brought up to question everything, some could question teachers but not parents, and so forth. I have already noted elsewhere that I got into terrible trouble for a well-meant email. Here's the rub: In the workplace, we naturally should be respectful of other people's cultures... but we don't have any idea what they are. It's like saying 'Some of my best friends are ....<fill in blank with stereotype.>' When my oldest son was 16, he had hair down to his waist. He was an indifferent student, but a gifted programmer. So in a last ditch effort to keep him engaged in learning, I took him to a local consulting firm to apply for a programming internship. I told him I thought he shoud cut his hair for the interview; he said that if they offered him a job and wanted him to cut it he'd consider it. Dropped him off - they gave all of the several dozen applicants tests - called him back for an interview and offered him a job the next week. I asked about his hair... he said it was no problem to them at all. Turns out the company was owned by a Sikh family, and they didn't think a thing about his hair (other than to ask him to put it up under his hat for site work at their client sites.) Kid 1. Mom 0. He's still a programmer, but for a university now. And he did cut his hair. It's in a mohawk now. On dress occasions, he dyes it blue."
DK,"I've read alot of your insightful ideas of culture and its affect on e-learning.  Culture, to me, is the values, beliefs, traditions and accepted behaviors that we accumulate throughout our lives - most heavily when we're young but as EP suggested, cultural change is absorbed at various rates and it may well be represented as a bell curve.  I like that idea.  To me, it's the lense in which we view the world - our perceptions, how we behave, what offends us, what makes us happy.  I was particularly stuck by the 'Iron & Silk' video where they were talking about their happiest moments and how different the idea of 'happiness' was in one culture vs. another. My definition of e-learning includes having to use some sort of technology to maintain connection with the teacher and fellowclassmates; ability to move forward & backward within a class to deepen and tailor individual's learning; immediate evaluation of what's being learned and the flexibility for the teacher and designers to alter the class/system; consistent, previously designed structure and stated expectations and goals; use of group and individual learning modes; need for some computer literacy and availability.  I'm new to the concept of e-learning but from what I've gathered so far, it's much more oriented towards flexibility of the learner in terms of learning style, life style and even intelligence and prior knowledge. We all get the same content but we might get differing depths of knowledge. In terms of how culture affects e-learning, it helps that we understand some of the cultural differences when developing and teaching courses.  For example, Lani & Sanchez (1998) mentioned how teaching adult Hispanic classes required a collaborative, action/activity-oriented approach that used real-world examples. Even such basic considerations like time, silence, motivation, authority need to be considered in developing elearning modules across cultures.  That being said, it really comes down to individuals and constant communication and feedback about what works and what doesn't.  I was born in Queens and raised on Long Island.  I hope that no one will ever label me a 'stereotypical New Yorker', although I do have some residual tendencies.  My phobias are crowds, lines, traffic and finding parking spaces....go figure. :) "
LW,"Hi TK that is interesting that you define culture in terms of the individual. I never looked at it from that perspective. I've always had a picture of a bunch of people standing on a map, on the country they live in, working as a group to create culture rather than one person who is affected by all that happens around him, thus creating culture. I think this is an important distinction and it broadens my concept of culture. "
EP,"Hi BS, You bring up a great example about language and translation! In many languages the meaning can not be directly translated into English and vice versa. It requires some understanding of how a native-speaker views the world, their social/cultural norms and perspectives, as you've said about the Dutch 'their entire attitude toward the world is different.' Also, you bring up a great point about the enormous potential for misunderstandings when communicating even among people whom we argueable share a common 'culture.' Even the art of 'selfdepreciation' can be misconstrued. My japanese teacher in college gave us a great example of crosscultural misunderstandings when communicating. In japan, they have the concept of  in-group and out-group. People in your 'in-group' are people like your family, friends and even company. People in your 'out-group' are everyone else you don't intimately associate with. So in the Japanese culture it is impolite to accept a compliment about someone or something in your 'in-group.' For example if I said, 'oh your daughter is so smart~!' You must respond with, 'oh no, no no she isn't.' This response is mandatory and expected! It doesn't mean you actually believe your daughter is dumb, but it is the culturally accepted response. But in the case of my Japanese teacher, who married a western man, when the two families met, her mother (japanese) gave the daughter-in-law a compliment, 'oh your daugher is so pretty.' To which the Western mom responded, 'I know.' Suffice to say, shock and appall from the japanese mom! Its amazing that something as simple as a compliment can have so much cultural undertone."
EP,"Hi KB, I agree with the direction your thoughts are taking you. :) I think in general we are not aware of the affect of our cultural programming. At the core, its something that is deeply imbedded in the way we, think, act, communicate and percieve the world. I think in general we begin to become aware of the nature of cultural programming when 1) we reflect upon our possible cultural programming and how it affects us (like in this class) and/or 2) when actually collide with a differing cultural perspective."
EP,"Hey LM, I always enjoy reading your posts! Your thoughts are so well-articulated. :) Its great that you bring up the question: 'If we examine the linguistic structure of such a language, do we gain insight into how to deal with or design learning systems for different ethic or cultural groups?' I know that from experience, cultural values and norms are sometimes built into the Asian language. For example, in the Japanese culture you mentioned the idea of heirarchy. The Japanese language has something called 'keigo' or honorifics. The basics of it are that based upon the social level of the person you are speaking to (higher or lower than yourself) you will change the structure of the verb or sentence you are using to adequetly convey and acknowledge the other person's level. Also, in China, for example humility and modesty are highly prized. They have a set phrase, 'na li na li' which doesn't really have meaning on its own (it shares the same characters as 'Where') but in the context of someone giving you a compliment it means, 'oh, its nothing' or 'oh, not really'. I think it is interesting to consider how the language and 'built-in' cultural values could have an impact on how learning systems are designed!"
MM,"Hi AN, You bring up a good point about American Midwestern cultural being vastly different than New Mexico culture. I think the same thing is true for Northern New Mexico culture being different as well. I am from Taos and when I moved to Albuquerque 10 years ago I had many people ask me where I was from because I had an accent. Some were shocked when I said Taos and others said they knew I had to be from Northern NM. Born and raised in Taos I never thought I had an accent, but now that I have been in Albuquerque awhile when I go back to Taos and talk to my parents and grandparents I can really hear the 'accent' :) "
GO,"Culture to me is one's knowledge, beliefs, values, way of life and mannerisms that are generally formed from association with groups of life minded individuals that form the way that they are. E-learning is the method in which one learns through the sources of technology rather than the traditional sources of learning. I think that the definition that I have is pretty similar to the definitions of others that I have read. I agree with what CJ has stated; how 'culture is unique to each others experience(s). I can personally relate to this through watching my adopted daughter blend within our family. It was difficult many times because her experiences, especially, with religion were quite different from what our family practiced. Our home was devoutly religious, whereas, in her places of residence prior to mine, there was no religious structure. I would say that the relationship between culture and e-learning would be that e-learning will help bridge the gap between the complexities of learning in areas where there is difficulties in obtaining other learning resources. E-learning also enhances social interactions between cultures therefore it helps to give a broader understanding to the way other people live. E-learning also increases the knowledge base and the more people know, the more they adapt to what they know and situate their lives accordingly."
GO,"Hello AN, I so agree with many of the points you stated here. Subcultures can be formulated all around us. Even where you attend school and the campus itself is a subculture. Upon arriving here (FINALLY an official resident from the midwest) on yesterday, my first walk on the campus was a complete culture shock to me from Chicago where I was born, raised, and attended for my bachelors program. The University here is quite more diverse than where I attended and it caused me to spend quite a bit of time sitting and observing. Also, concerning the constitution, I believe like you stated that it sets us apart from the rest of the world. However, I think in some cases it helps to destroy our appreciation and respect for the diverse cultures within this nation. The various freedoms that are given to us through the constitution are often times abused by those taking its meaning and twisting it to become their forums or stepping stones to pronounce violence and hatred on others. (Ex. freedom of speech) "
DK,"Can I chime in...?  I think we most often become aware of our 'cultural programming' when we collide with others from different cultures or see others collide.  Last year, my daughters and I went on a bus tour of the Celtic countries.  Most of our tour mates were from Australia but there were a few families from the US.  The Aussies told us in polite conversation that we Americans work entirely too hard and don't take holiday enough.  They go for weeks and my family saved for 14 years for 10 days worth of a dream vacation. Because one American couple got caught up in shopping, it made us late and we could only race to Stone Henge and take a picture and run back to the bus.  Most everyone thought it was great fun but an American family made such a fuss and even spoke about reducing the tip to our tour guide, who had been amazing.  It was not about the experience for them but because we work so hard for it, even our relaxation time is about getting their money's worth. I think that's an American trait that people from other cultures judge us as a whole upon.  I'm embarassed by it but I know I've fallen into that trap when my daughters were young - wanting them to see Goofy at Disneyland, for example.  It's interesting to think about - sorry for the tangent. "
