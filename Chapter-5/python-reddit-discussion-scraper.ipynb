(Excuse the little rant) So when I come to school and they try to test me on what I wrote, I’m still able to pass, so doing these things doesn’t eliminate cheating, it eliminates people that dont know what they are talking about from cheating.

      "This is literally the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Genuinely, this is no way similar to a calculator. A calculator tells you what 2(5+7)/6(8-9) is without having to do take the time to do it yourself with room for error, while every kid can still take the time and break it down themselves, the calculator just simplifies it with 100% accuracy. AI in this scenario will legitimately comes up with the points/arguments and articulates them for the writer, that’s not similar at all. The AI equivalent of a calculator would be spell checking and grammar checking, AI to write whole essays is the equivalent of taking a picture of math problem and writing down the answer it gives you. Doesn’t take a genius to see the difference in the two.\n",

      "This lady is great at saying stupid shit and making it seem smart, make the kids write essays in class. Simple. Critiquing a paper does nothing, I can critique and edit  literally any paper after reading it 2 times, even if it’s covering a topic I know nothing about. How does this help kids in any way? The answer? It doesn’t, it doesn’t *at all*. I’m gonna sound like a boomer, but this a sure fire way to make kids dumb as fuck and impossible to create their own arguments, but will create a whole generation of “well akshually…” kids. This is beyond fucking stupid. Writing an essay is not hard at all, a 2 page essay can be done in 30-50 minutes depending in writing typing speed, and the writer will be knowledgeable about what they wrote with the ability to defend it.\n",

      "Totally nailed it. Critical thinking skills are the way to a good career. Anyone can google a few things but it takes an intelligent person to take in and present / use that information. Also, I hated writing papers in school. I was always so stressed about the fact that I needed to take time to not only get a good amount of research in, but I also had to write the damn paper. And I was so slow at writing my research would be at a total minimum and I never felt like I could really take interest in what I was writing about because if the process I needed to follow. This leads to kids dreading writing assignments because there is 0 time to be interested in the material when all you have the time for is the execution.

They usually last ~50 minutes (at least they did when I was in school) and at unless the teacher and class is disciplined they'll spend 5-10 minutes fucking around at the start and end of the period. There's so much wasted time in education... Anyway some teachers, on test days, would stand at the door and hand out tests as you walked in. I liked those times because it gave you more time for the test. Even still say you get the full 50 minutes that's often only enough time for a page or three, depending on age.\n",

      "Critiquing and improving is just making the idea come across better in certain areas. The above comment said something about children using their own thoughts. Having an AI write for them and then just having students critique that won't really help them with their own writing as the AI may not even write an essay based on that students' opinion. How are they going to be able to create their own pre-planning or paragraphs and form their own ideas if they aren't even required to do any of that work. Imagine being able to have AI write all of your essays for you as you go through school then you go to college and can't even write your own essay because you never have before? I can't even imagine people going for their master's or doctorate because they won't even be able to write a thesis or dissertation. It just sets them up for failure in the long run because now we aren't teaching how to write original ideas or argumentals with opinions as they will just rely on whatever the AI decides to write. Not saying critiquing and improving written text isn't needed, but it sure isn't the only skills needed to be a good writer.\n",

It was just so much universally poorly written garbage ideas lazily done that it was making me depressed and I just had to remove myself from that.  I also concluded that beyond not being able to write most of them had nothing to say about what they were writing about.  They didn't understand it well enough and couldn't formulate cogent opinions around it much less defend those.  At the end if anyone were to bring a paper to me I would have them put it away and just tell me what they thought about what topic they were working.  If it was just retarded blathering I knew enough not to waste my time reading the paper.
