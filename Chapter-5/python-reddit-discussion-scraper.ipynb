      "Gonna be honest, I have used ChatGPT on essays, and because of the school I go to, teachers already do some of this stuff. A lot of times the reason I use AI is not because I dont know how to do it, its because I’m bored of writing these stupid essays that are all in the same format and always “why this” and “explain this” like, let me write a fantasy story, then I’ll take your class fucking serious. (Excuse the little rant) So when I come to school and they try to test me on what I wrote, I’m still able to pass, so doing these things doesn’t eliminate cheating, it eliminates people that dont know what they are talking about from cheating. If two students wrote a paper using AI, one of them still knows the material and one of them doesnt, one will fail and the other wont. Both still cheated.\n",

AI in this scenario will legitimately comes up with the points/arguments and articulates them for the writer, that’s not similar at all.

      "Totally nailed it. Critical thinking skills are the way to a good career. Anyone can google a few things but it takes an intelligent person to take in and present / use that information. Also, I hated writing papers in school. I was always so stressed about the fact that I needed to take time to not only get a good amount of research in, but I also had to write the damn paper. And I was so slow at writing my research would be at a total minimum and I never felt like I could really take interest in what I was writing about because if the process I needed to follow. This leads to kids dreading writing assignments because there is 0 time to be interested in the material when all you have the time for is the execution. And people wonder why young people do the minimum.\n",

      "Critiquing and improving is just making the idea come across better in certain areas. The above comment said something about children using their own thoughts. Having an AI write for them and then just having students critique that won't really help them with their own writing as the AI may not even write an essay based on that students' opinion. How are they going to be able to create their own pre-planning or paragraphs and form their own ideas if they aren't even required to do any of that work. Imagine being able to have AI write all of your essays for you as you go through school then you go to college and can't even write your own essay because you never have before? I can't even imagine people going for their master's or doctorate because they won't even be able to write a thesis or dissertation. It just sets them up for failure in the long run because now we aren't teaching how to write original ideas or argumentals with opinions as they will just rely on whatever the AI decides to write. Not saying critiquing and improving written text isn't needed, but it sure isn't the only skills needed to be a good writer.\n",

Of course it has no effect but they do it.  I was being a bit poetic with that but I meant help, in this case AI help.  Whether it's cheating is open for debate.  I only mean it to be help.  BTW, I stopped reading college essays when students would come to me an essentially say I shitted this out late last night I don't intend to read it myself or correct it so you go ahead and fix it.  It was just so much universally poorly written garbage ideas lazily done that it was making me depressed and I just had to remove myself from that.  I also concluded that beyond not being able to write most of them had nothing to say about what they were writing about.  They didn't understand it well enough and couldn't formulate cogent opinions around it much less defend those.  At the end if anyone were to bring a paper to me I would have them put it away and just tell me what they thought about what topic they were working.  If it was just retarded blathering I knew enough not to waste my time reading the paper.  Most college papers are like this at the undergraduate level and at the masters level is mostly just lazy shit by people who mostly don't have the time to do anything much better.\n",
