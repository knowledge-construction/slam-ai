Gonna be honest, I have used ChatGPT on essays, and because of the school I go to, teachers already do some of this stuff. A lot of times the reason I use AI is not because I dont know how to do it, its because I’m bored of writing these stupid essays that are all in the same format and always “why this” and “explain this” like, let me write a fantasy story, then I’ll take your class fucking serious. (Excuse the little rant) So when I come to school and they try to test me on what I wrote, I’m still able to pass, so doing these things doesn’t eliminate cheating, it eliminates people that dont know what they are talking about from cheating. If two students wrote a paper using AI, one of them still knows the material and one of them doesnt, one will fail and the other wont. Both still cheated."

If it's so bad that every student has to be assumed to be cheating, just.. Just do the testing and essays and paperwork in school. Stop giving out weird long and pointless homework.   


When I was in highschool the varying teachers didn't coordinate at all, so some nights we'd have an impossible amount of homework to do. Which often led to very few of us actually doing most of the work.   


Imagine you're home from school around 4pm, and you now have 2 hours of algebra homework and 2 hours of english homework, and 1 hour of history homework, and 3 hours of chemistry homework. You have to use a bulky outdated textbook for each and if you have any issue you can't get ahold of your teacher for help.

Firstly, it can provide personalized assistance to students, offering explanations, clarifications, and additional practice on various subjects. This tailored support can help struggling students catch up, and challenge high-achievers to excel further.

Moreover, ChatGPT can assist teachers in creating and refining educational materials. It can generate custom worksheets, essay prompts, and even suggest creative lesson plans. This saves teachers time and allows them to focus on other critical aspects of education.

Additionally, ChatGPT can be used for language learning and improvement. It can engage students in interactive language exercises, correct grammar and vocabulary usage, and facilitate conversations in a chosen language.

Furthermore, it can foster inclusivity by providing support to students with diverse learning needs. For instance, it can offer alternative explanations, formats, or resources for students with varying learning styles or accessibility requirements.

Lastly, ChatGPT can facilitate distance learning. It can serve as a virtual tutor, offering guidance and support to students studying remotely, ensuring they have access to educational resources and assistance even outside of traditional classroom settings.

Overall, ChatGPT's adaptability, scalability, and personalized assistance make it a valuable asset for schools, enhancing the learning experience for both students and teachers."

What the fear-mongerers are not appreciating is that AI absolutely cannot respond to types of events that it hasn't encountered before, and that happens in every instant of every second. It is always behind the curve knowledge-wise, and it cannot come up with new solutions to new problems. I have spent hours having to connect dots across various disciplines for ChatGPT because they do not exist.

A calculator tells you what 2(5+7)/6(8-9) is without having to do take the time to do it yourself with room for error, while every kid can still take the time and break it down themselves, the calculator just simplifies it with 100% accuracy. AI in this scenario will legitimately comes up with the points/arguments and articulates them for the writer, that’s not similar at all. The AI equivalent of a calculator would be spell checking and grammar checking, AI to write whole essays is the equivalent of taking a picture of math problem and writing down the answer it gives you. Doesn’t take a genius to see the difference in the two.

This lady is great at saying stupid shit and making it seem smart, make the kids write essays in class. Simple. Critiquing a paper does nothing, I can critique and edit  literally any paper after reading it 2 times, even if it’s covering a topic I know nothing about. How does this help kids in any way? The answer? It doesn’t, it doesn’t *at all*. I’m gonna sound like a boomer, but this a sure fire way to make kids dumb as fuck and impossible to create their own arguments, but will create a whole generation of “well akshually…” kids.

The problem is students are using ChatGPT to cheat on essays and it is hard to tell who is using it and who is not.

The solution requires counterintuitive thinking: What if we assume this is not a problem? What if we assume that all students are using ChatGPT and that it can not be detected?

With those two questions in mind, the answer becomes clear: Encourage students to use ChatGPT. Adopt a plan for students that centers around using ChatGPT. Essays in class, critical critiques and discussions on ChatGPT's responses, how to ask the right questions for ChatGPT to enhance learning, etc."

>Writing an essay is not hard at all, a 2 page essay can be done in 30-50 minutes depending in writing typing speed, and the writer will be knowledgeable about what they wrote with the ability to defend it.

This is completely subjective. Personally, essays take an incredibly long time and are arduous to write, even on topics I am knowledgeable about. I can have an academic conversation easily on the matter, but essay writing really only tests your ability to convert your thoughts and ideas into succinct phrasing. I would argue the understanding of the concepts themselves are far more important than the actual essay writing.

Hi, I'm a middle school teacher. I specialize in technology. I'm also working on a PhD in developmental psychology, specializing in teenage brain development.

One of the things TikTok and social media has done has actually gotten teens to be able to code switch faster between situations and concepts. As a result, they can go from a full conversation, to class work, to back, in significantly less time. They can utilize language differently because they recognize that words have different meanings in different fields, and swap back and forth quickly and easily. 

You'd think this means that their attention spans are shorter, but they aren't. They're paradoxically *longer,* they just require more mental and social stimulation while doing these things. 

So they will actually spend *more* time on an assignment, but only if they can also chat with their friends while they do it. Their friends may also bounce ideas back at them, improving their thinking process and empathy."

Learning the equation for the volume of a cylinder isn't the point of geometry (the point is to learn how to think analytically), but it WAS the thing required for the test.

However, if we have tools now that just tell us the year that a painting was made, or will remember all of the volume equations for us, then what does a human need to do?  Humans need to know when, how, and why to apply these tools, and AI is going to be the biggest tool we have.

No one is saying to replace human expression with AI (and let's not pretend that academic assignments are how people express themselves - they do that in their spare time, assignments are just work).  We want to use AI to augment how we perform the functions required of us, and school needs to start teaching that.

There were horribly outdated assignments that do not apply the industry in modern day. For old ass algorithms or dead languages chat gpt was used so I could use that time elsewhere learning the current field. Your argument is silly bro not everything is worth learning 100%
306,k0oy2zh,t1_k0okkio,2023-09-15 13:11:01 UTC,tendadsnokids,Using AI in schools,1,1,95% of jobs are going to be impacted by generative AI. Any person who isn't learning how to use it to its maximum potential will be completely irrelevant in the workplace. My fiance is a professional writer and uses it every day. Her work brought in specific trainers and basically told them to figure out how to use it or start finding a different career.

A good example is film appreciation, where you learn how to explain what you like and dislike about a movie, to look for the basic structure and themes that allow you to better appreciate how you watch and talk about media.

>No one is saying to replace human expression with AI 

Except for the people who are literally saying this, right? You're the one that brought humanities into this and now you're saying to not pretend that humanities aren't about humanities.

>Finally, based on your last couple of sentences, it sounds more like you're just against AI in general

Gee, I wonder how you were able to crack this heavily secret coded message. Without even checking your post history, I'm going to guess you're tech person, likely lurking in r/ProgrammerHumor with a hobby of gaming and software, who tells themselves ""I have amazing ideas it takes too much time to actually make them happen"", probably a failed artist that struggles at the most basic attribute and rather than learn and improve, sees AI as your one chance at gaining talent.

Considering that AI us made using stolen assets and any inclusion of AI into anything creative is met with insane backlash because actual artists want nothing to do with your ""tool"" and is primarily used by untalented hacks like yourself, then yea, you can say that myself, along with most of society, is against Ai."

Studying can take many forms. Skipping work is not sadly. Using chatGPT to learn more about the class in a way that will teach you what you expected ? Why not ! As long as you put in the work."

But there's a difference between using it for work, and using it to skip studying.

Would you show up on a motorcycle at a marathon event and say ""These idiots are running but I'm smarter than them"" ? Studying, even if it's not always done very well (for sure), is meant to teach YOU. It doesn't matter that the teacher is content or not with your work, you are the end result. Skipping this is shooting yourself in the foot."

I completely understand the importance of kids doing work. The point of this video is that it's on teachers to find ways to work with generative AI because, even in it's early stages, it is making writing skills less valuable by the day.

If you went to school to be an accountant it would be ludicrous to pretend like excel doesn't exist."

If you take shortcuts instead of learning, then you never learn.

Would you be okay with me claiming it's not necessary to know how to read, just use an AI to make a text-to-voice translation for you ?"
316,k0po0w3,t1_k0p0oni,2023-09-15 15:56:05 UTC,tendadsnokids,Using AI in schools,1,0,"There is a difference between being able to functionally read/write and using generative AI to lighten the proverbial load. 

I wouldn't tell a first grade teacher to start teaching LLMs instead of literacy skills, but if you're in college you should be learning how to maximize output and productivity in a way that is acceptable in the workforce. 

Right now AI just plain isn't good enough to get you to ace your college classes by itself. But when it gets there (which will be within a few years at most), there needs to be a proper examination on what skills we value and which skills just don't make sense teaching anymore. We can both agree that taking short cuts hurts the learning goal, but if the learning goal isn't particularly important to begin with then what's the point of practicing that skill to begin with. 

I think a lot about the Dewey decimal system that I learned in elementary school. We were taught it because it was an essential skill for research when you had to go to a physical library to write research papers. Once computers became so mainstream it was functionally useless. 

I know I'm getting away from your point but if teachers are making you practice doing something that can be done proficiently with a chatbot then it's a problem with the curriculum."
